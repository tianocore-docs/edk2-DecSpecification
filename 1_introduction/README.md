# 1 Introduction

This document describes the EDK II Declaration (DEC) file format. This format
was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules,
as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build
infrastructure. EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of
a distribution that follows the _UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution
Package Specification_. They may also be created manually.

The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4
(Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.

This version of the specification clarifies (or enables) existing content, no
new content has been introduced.
