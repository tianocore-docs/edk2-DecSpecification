most existing EDK drivers with the EDK II build environment and EDK II
platforms.

**EFI**

Generic term that refers to one of the versions of the EFI specification: EFI
1.02, EFI 1.10 or any version of the UEFI specification.

**FDF**

EDK II Flash definition file. This file is used to define the content and

This term is used throughout this document to describe one of the following:

* An image that is loaded into a hardware device on a platform - traditional
  ROM image

* An image that is loaded into an Option ROM device on an add-in card

* A bootable image that is installed on removable, bootable media, such as a
  Floppy, CD-ROM or USB storage device.

* An image that is contains update information that will be processed by OS
  Runtime services to interact with EFI Runtime services to update a
  traditional ROM image.

* A UEFI application that can be accessed during boot (at an EFI Shell Prompt),
  prior to hand-off to the OS Loader.

**Foundation**

The set of code and interfaces that glue implementations of EFI together.

**Framework**

Intel(R) Platform Innovation Framework for EFI consists of the Foundation, plus
other modular components that characterize the portability surface for modular
components designed to work on any implementation of the EFI architecture.

**GUID**

Globally Unique Identifier. A 128-bit value used to name entities uniquely. A
unique GUID can be generated by an individual without the help of a centralized
authority. This allows the generation of names that will never conflict, even
among multiple, unrelated parties. GUID values can be registry format
(8-4-4-4-12) or C data structure format.

GUID also refers to an API named by a GUID.

**HII**

Human Interface Infrastructure. This generally refers to the database that
contains string, font, and IFR information along with other pieces that use one
of the database components.

**HOB**

Hand-off blocks are key architectural mechanisms that are used to hand off
system information in the early pre-boot stages.

**IFR**

Internal Forms Representation. This is the binary encoding that is used for the
representation of user interface pages.

**INF**

EDK II Module Information File. This file describes how the module is coded.
For EDK, this file describes how the component or library is coded as well as
providing some basic build information.

* Source INF - An EDK II Module Information file that contains content in a
  [Sources] section and it does not contain a [Binaries] section. If the
  [Binaries] section is empty or the only entries in the [Binaries] section are
  of type DISPOSABLE, then the [Binaries] section is ignored.

* Binary INF - An EDK II Module Information file that has a [Binaries] section
  and does not contain a [Sources] section or the [Sources] section is empty.

* Mixed INF - An EDK II Module Information file that contains content in both
  [Sources] and [Binaries] sections and there are entries in the [Binaries]
  section are not of type `DISPOSABLE`

* AsBuilt INF - An EDK II Module Information file generated by the EDK II build
  system when building source content (listed in a [Sources] section).

**Library Class**

A library class defines the API or interface set for a library. The consumer
of the library is coded to the library class definition. Library classes are
defined via a library class .h file that is published by a package.

**Library Instance**

An implementation of one or more library classes.

**Module**

A module is either an executable image or a library instance.

**Module Type**

All libraries and components belong to one of the following module types: `BASE`,
`SEC`, `PEI_CORE`, `PEIM`, `DXE_CORE`, `DXE_DRIVER`, `DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER`, `DXE_SMM_DRIVER`,
`DXE_SAL_DRIVER`, `UEFI_DRIVER`, or `UEFI_APPLICATION`. These definitions provide a
framework that is consistent with a similar set of requirements. A module that
is of module type BASE, depends only on headers and libraries provided in the
MDE, while a module that is of module type DXE_DRIVER depends on common DXE
components. The EDK II build system also permits modules of type `USER_DEFINED`.
These modules will not be processed by the EDK II Build system. See
[Table 2 EDK II Module Types](appendix_b_edk_ii_module_types.md#table-2-edk-ii-module-types).

**Package**

A package is a container. It can hold a collection of files for any given set
of modules. Packages may be described as one of the following types of modules:

- source modules, containing all source files and descriptions of a module

- binary modules, containing EFI Sections or a Framework File System and a
  description file specific to linking and binary editing of features and
  attributes specified in a Platform Configuration Database (PCD,)

- mixed modules, with both binary and source modules

Multiple modules can be combined into a package, and multiple packages can be
combined into a single package.

**PCD**

Platform Configuration Database.

**PEI**

Pre-EFI Initialization Phase.

**PEIM**

An API named by a GUID.

**PPI**

A PEIM-to-PEIM Interface that is named by a GUID.

**Protocol**

An API named by a GUID.

**Runtime Services**

Interfaces that provide access to underlying platform-specific hardware that
might be useful during OS runtime, such as time and date services. These
services become active during the boot process but also persist after the OS
loader terminates boot services.

**SAL**

System Abstraction Layer. A firmware interface specification used on Intel(R)
Itanium(R) Processor based systems.

**SEC**

Security Phase is the code in the Framework that contains the processor reset
vector and launches PEI. This phase is separate from PEI because some security
schemes require ownership of the reset vector.

**SKU**

Stock Keeping Unit.

**SMM**

System Management Mode. A generic term for the execution mode entered when a
CPU detects an SMI. The firmware, in response to the interrupt type, will gain
control in physical mode. For this document, "SMM" describes the operational
regime for IA32 and x64 processors that share the OS-transparent
characteristics.

**UEFI Application**

An application that follows the UEFI specification. The only difference between
a UEFI application and a UEFI driver is that an application is unloaded from
memory when it exits regardless of return status, while a driver that returns a
successful return status is not unloaded when its entry point exits.

**UEFI Driver**

A driver that follows the _UEFI specification_.

**UEFI Specification Version 2.4**

Current UEFI version.

**UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification Version 1.0**

The current version of this specification includes Errata B.

**UEFI Platform Initialization Specification 1.3**

Current version of the PI specification.

**Unified EFI Forum**

A non-profit collaborative trade organization formed to promote and manage the
UEFI standard. For more information, see http://www.uefi.org.

**VFR**

Visual Forms Representation.

**VPD**

Vital Product Data that is read-only binary configuration data, typically
located within a region of a flash part. This data would typically be updated
as part of the firmware build, post firmware build (via patching tools),
through automation on a manufacturing line as the 'FLASH' parts are programmed
or through special tools.
