#### Parameters

**_Abstract_**

A brief one line description of what the package provides.

**_BinaryAbstract_**

A brief one line description of what the packages provides that may be
different from a source abstract.

**_Description_**

A detailed description of what the package provides.

**_BinaryDescription_**

A detailed description of what the package provides that may be different from
a source description.

**_Copyright_**

The copyright date should be modified if there is a functional change to the
source code. Since binaries are constructed from source, the binary file uses
the same copyright date as the source DEC, however tools are not required to
ensure that the dates are identical.

**_License_**

One or more licenses that the package with source code is released under.

**_BinaryLicense_**

One or more licenses that the binary package is released under that may be
different from the licenses used for distributing the package with source code.
