## 2.4 [Defines] Usage

This is a required section.

The `[Defines]` section is used to track the package's GUID and version, which
allows multiple copies of the same package with different versions to be
processed by tools. Architectural modifiers are not permitted in the
`[Defines]` section. If major changes to a package occur, the GUID value of the
package must also change.

The `DEC_SPECIFICATION` of existing DEC files does not need to be updated unless
content in the file has been updated to match new content specified by this
revision of the specification. Additionally, the package's version major number
may change. Minor changes require incrementing the package's version minor
number. The

`PACKAGE_UNI_FILE` entry points to a Unicode file containing localization
strings. The use of the #include statement in this file is prohibited. The file
path (if present) is relative to the directory containing the DEC file.

The parsing utilities process any local symbol assignments defined in this
section. Note that the sections are processed in the order listed in the DEC
file, and later assignments of these local symbols override previous
assignments.

This section will use only one section header:

`[Defines]`

The format for entries in this section is:

`Name = Value`

The following is an example of this section.

```ini
[Defines]
  DEC_SPECIFICATION = 0x0001001A
  PACKAGE_NAME      = MdePkg
  PACKAGE_GUID      = 1E73767F-8F52-4603-AEB4-F29B510B6766
  PACKAGE_VERSION   = 1.02
  PACKAGE_UNI_FILE  = MdePkg.uni
```
